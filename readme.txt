RG_spectra_Age.xlsm --- Our reseach sample: the stellar parameters corresponding to the 5349 LAMOST spectra.

Modeling.m --- This is a program to build a red giant star age estimation model using tye back propagation neural network training data, which uses (1:Teff,2:[Fe/H],3:logg,4:¦Ímax, 5:delta ¦Í) as input parameters.

Optimal_model.mat --- This is the best red giant age estimation model structure obtained when using (1:Teff,2:[Fe/H],3:logg,4:¦Ímax, 5:delta ¦Í) as input parameters.
